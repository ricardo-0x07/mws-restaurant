## Project Overview: Stage 2

This project is being incrementally convert from a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I toke a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.
